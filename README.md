# SharpGpx 1.0

## Project Description

SharpGpx implements an object model for reading and writing GPX ([GPS eXchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_eXchange_Format)). An extremely common format, GPX is used to record data and exchange data from GPS units.

## Details

The library is developed under .NET 4.0 and has no external dependencies.

The library makes extensive use of [XML Serialization](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms950721.aspx). Extremely large files may fail to save or load.

## Development

This library makes use of a code generator based on the _xsd.exe_ utility. The generator reads in an [XML Schema Document (XSD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema) and generates C# classes from the schema. You shouldn't need to edit the GPX XSDs. If you do, you're basically tampering with the [GPX standard](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp). Also, Visual Studio will attempt to regenerate the code, won't find the code generator installed on your system, and probably give you an error.

You can either 
* not edit the XSDs (best choice)
* install the [XsdToClasses](http://code.google.com/p/xsd-to-classes/) utility, and regenerate the code -- this would be useful if the standard changes, or there is a new one introduced.
* remove references to the code generator and just use the code
  * Back up the generated files ending in "Generated.cs"
  * Edit the properties of the XSD file in Visual Studio to remove the reference to _XsdToClasses_ from the "custom tool" field.
  * restore the "generated" files back to the project.
